This is a website that conducts a user research study, putting three images at a time in front of a user (test subject), and asks them to click their favorite. This occurs 25 times, and the results are stored. Afterwards, a button is presented that says "see results". Clicking this button displays the cumulative study results in both a bulleted list and horizontal bar graph format.
